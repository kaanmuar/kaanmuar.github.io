      # Step 1: Checks out your repository's code
      - name: Check out repository
        uses: actions/checkout@v4

      # Step 2: Sets up Node.js, which is needed to run npm
      - name: Set up Node.js
        uses: actions/setup-node@v4
        with:
          node-version: '20'

      # Step 3: Installs all project dependencies (Cypress, Robot Framework, Playwright, etc.)
      - name: Install dependencies
        run: npm ci

      # --- NEW: Step 4: Install Playwright Browsers ---
      # This is the most important new step. It downloads the browsers (Chrome, Firefox, WebKit)
      # that Playwright needs to run your tests inside the GitHub environment.
      - name: Install Playwright Browsers
        run: npx playwright install --with-deps

      # --- Step 5: Run all test suites ---
      # Each test run has "continue-on-error: true" so that if one suite fails,
      # the others will still run and all reports will be generated.

      - name: Run Cypress Tests
        run: npm run test:cy

      - name: Run Robot Framework Tests
        run: npm run test:robot
        continue-on-error: true

      # --- Step 6: Upload all test reports and artifacts ---
